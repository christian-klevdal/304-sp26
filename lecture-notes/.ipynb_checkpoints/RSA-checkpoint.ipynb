    "# Cryptography and RSA\n",

    "Cryptography is the study and practice of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversaries. It involves transforming information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it, while preventing unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll explore how number theory provides the mathematical foundation for modern cryptography, particularly through the RSA encryption system. This is a really neat application of modular arithmetic and some of the structure we have uncovered there!\n",

    "#### Converting Text to Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "In cryptography, we want to send messages, and classically this means messages conisting of text, like \"Bet all on red\". In modern days, we may want to send text, or other information like bank account information etc, in a secure matter. For mathematical cryptography, we are mostly concerned with sending numbers, but if you can do this securely, then you can also send text or anything else you want by just turning your information into numbers. We call this process **integrification**, since we are turning information into integers. This section runs through one possible way of doing that.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrification \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of integrification is that it allows us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply mathematical transformations to messages\n",
    "- Use modular arithmetic for encryption\n",
    "- Leverage properties of prime numbers and number theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to map each letter to a number. A common approach is:\n",
    "- A → 0, B → 1, C → 2, ..., Z → 25\n",
    "\n",
    "For longer messages, we can represent entire words or sentences as a single large integer using a **base-26 representation**. For example, if we have the letters with values $a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$ (where each $a_i$ is between 0 and 25), we can create the integer:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M = a_0 \\cdot 26^{n-1} + a_1 \\cdot 26^{n-2} + \\cdots + a_{n-1} \\cdot 26^0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This converts any text string into a unique integer, which we can then encrypt using mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you may want to include other characters, like spaces, punctuation, numbers,..., and maybe you care about the difference between upper case and lower case letters. We won't worry about any of this, and in the following we will only care about letters (not spaces or any other characters) which are not case sensitive. "

    "## The RSA Cryptosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "The _RSA algorithm_, named after its inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (1977), is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. Its security is based on the computational difficulty of factoring large integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA relies on the following mathematical concepts from number theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Euler's totient function:_ For a positive integer $n$, $\\phi(n)$ counts the number of integers from 1 to $n$ that are coprime to $n$.\n",
    "   - If $n = pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, then $\\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _Euler's theorem:_ If $\\gcd(a, n) = 1$, then $a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. _Modular multiplicative inverses:_ If $\\gcd(e, \\phi(n)) = 1$, there exists a unique $d$ modulo $\\phi(n)$ such that $ed \\equiv 1 \\pmod{\\phi(n)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RSA Key Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up RSA encryption, we perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Choose two large prime numbers_ $p$ and $q$.\n",
    "2. _Compute_ $n = pq$. This will be the **modulus** for both encryption and decryption.\n",
    "3. _Compute_ $\\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$.\n",
    "4. _Choose an encryption exponent_ $e$ such that $1 < e < \\phi(n)$ and $\\gcd(e, \\phi(n)) = 1$.\n",
    "5. _Compute the decryption exponent_ $d$ such that $de \\equiv 1 \\pmod{\\phi(n)}$.\n",
    "   - In other words, $d = e^{-1} \\bmod \\phi(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **public key** is the pair $(n, e)$, which can be shared openly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **private key** is the pair $(n, d)$, which must be kept secret. The primes $p$ and $q$ should also be kept secret (or destroyed after generating the keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RSA Encryption and Decryption\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the keys are generated:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encryption**: To encrypt a message $M$ (represented as an integer with $0 \\leq M < n$), compute:\n",
    "$$C = M^e \\bmod n$$\n",
    "where $C$ is the ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decryption**: To decrypt the ciphertext $C$, compute:\n",
    "$$M = C^d \\bmod n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works**: Since $ed \\equiv 1 \\pmod{\\phi(n)}$, we have $ed = 1 + k\\phi(n)$ for some integer $k$. Therefore:\n",
    "$$C^d \\equiv (M^e)^d = M^{ed} = M^{1+k\\phi(n)} = M \\cdot (M^{\\phi(n)})^k \\equiv M \\cdot 1^k = M \\pmod{n}$$\n",
    "by Euler's theorem. If you are astute, you've noticed that we used Euler's theorem here but we didn't check that $M$ satisfies the hypothesis that $\\gcd(M, n) = 1$. In fact, this won't always be the case, but miraculously $M^{ed} \\equiv M \\mod n$ even when $\\gcd(M,N) \\neq 1$! \n",
