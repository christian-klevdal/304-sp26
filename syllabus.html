            <h2>Problem Sets</h2>
            <p>Problem sets will be assigned weekly and are due on <strong>Fridays at 5:00 PM</strong>. Problem sets are an essential component of the course and provide practice with the concepts and techniques covered in lecture.</p>
            
            <h3>Late Policy</h3>
            <p>Late work may be accepted on a case-by-case basis, but there must be a good reason for the late submission. Please communicate with the instructor as soon as possible if you anticipate difficulty meeting a deadline.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> After one week, homework will not be accepted for any reason. Plan accordingly and don't wait until the last minute to start your assignments.</p>
            
            <p>Students are encouraged to work together on problem sets and discuss approaches to problems. However, each student must write up their own solutions independently. Copying solutions from other students or online sources is not permitted.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="midterms">
            <h2>Midterms</h2>
            <p>Midterms will be held in class. Students are allowed to use calculators during the exam. However, the exams are closed book and closed notes. The exams will be cumulative, covering all material discussed up to the exam date.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="textbook">
            <h2>Textbook</h2>
            <p><strong>Required:</strong> Joseph H. Silverman, <em>A Friendly Introduction to Number Theory</em> (4th Edition)</p>
            <p>Reading assignments from the textbook will be posted on the course schedule. Additional resources and materials will be provided through the course website.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="attendance">
            <h2>Attendance and Participation</h2>
            <p><strong>Lecture:</strong> Tuesday/Thursday, 9:00-10:15 AM in Bloomberg 168</p>
            <p><strong>Discussion Section:</strong> Friday, 9:00-9:50 AM in Bloomberg 276</p>
            
            <p>Regular attendance at both lectures and discussion sections is expected. Discussion sections provide an opportunity to work through problems, ask questions, and solidify your understanding of the material. Section attendance counts for 2% of your final grade.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Week 7 (March 3-5) will be conducted remotely. Details will be provided closer to the date.</p>

        <section id="resources">
            <h2>Additional Resources</h2>
            <p>We will use <strong>SageMath</strong> throughout the course for computational exploration of number-theoretic concepts. No prior programming experience is required; tutorials and examples will be provided on the course website.</p>
            
            <p>Office hours for the instructor and TA are listed on the course homepage. Please take advantage of office hours if you have questions or need additional help with the material.</p>

        <section id="academic-integrity">
            <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
            <p>Students are expected to adhere to the Johns Hopkins University Academic Integrity policies. All work submitted must be your own. While collaboration on problem sets is encouraged, you must write up your solutions independently. Any violations of academic integrity will be taken seriously and reported to the appropriate university authorities.</p>

            <h3>AI Policy</h3>
            <p>The use of AI tools, such as ChatGPT or similar, is permitted for brainstorming and general guidance. However, all submitted work must be your own. Direct copying of AI-generated content is not allowed and will be considered a violation of academic integrity.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> I strongly discourage reliance on AI tools. They are frequently incorrect, and if you rely on them without attempting the problems yourself, you will likely struggle on the midterms and not perform well.</p>
